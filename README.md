# Pickly

In a world overwhelmed by noise, we’re building a space for clarity, connection, and care.  
Here, real people share real recommendations — not for attention, but for intention.

**No likes. No followers. Just curated content.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

Pickly is a minimalist content curation platform designed to encourage meaningful sharing.  
Instead of chasing likes or followers, users contribute intentionally recommended content — like a book, a podcast, a video, or an article — for the benefit of others.
